## nginx-overlay

This repository contains additional versions of gentoo's nginx ebuilds.

The main purpose is to keep older versions around for those that prefer to use
releases from the nginx 'stable' branch, although [upstream recommendation][1]
is to stick with mainline.

The repository will additionally contain newer and/or experimental versions
that requires additional testing before landing in the gentoo portage tree.

Older ebuilds will use unstable (~) keywording while experimental ebuilds
lacks any keywording. Please adjust your portage configuration
accordingly.

If you want to contribute, feel free to fork this repository and create a
pull request.
